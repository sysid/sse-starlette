"""
Test comparing functools.partial vs lambda reference semantics.

This test module proves that functools.partial DOES NOT solve the reference
cycle problem, contrary to the initial Phase A recommendation.

Key findings:
- Lambda: Captures self via closure
- Partial: Captures self via bound method's __self__
- Both create identical reference chains in exception contexts
- Partial actually increases refcount MORE than lambda
