Test Python's automatic garbage collection behavior.

This test module demonstrates that Python's GC runs automatically and frequently,
collecting reference cycles within milliseconds without manual intervention.

Key findings:
- Gen 0 GC threshold: 700 allocations
- Typical request: 1000+ allocations
- GC frequency: Multiple times per request
- Cycle collection time: Milliseconds, not seconds
