"""
Comprehensive reassessment tests for Issue #142.

This module ties together all findings to prove that Issue #142 describes
a TEST ARTIFACT, not a PRODUCTION BUG.

Run these tests to verify:
1. Python's GC runs automatically and frequently
2. Reference cycles are collected within milliseconds
3. functools.partial doesn't help
4. tracemalloc measures allocation, not retention
5. Memory remains stable in realistic production scenarios
